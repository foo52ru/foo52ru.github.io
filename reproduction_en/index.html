<h1>The advantage of sexual reproduction over asexual</h1>

<p>Let's try to compare sexual and asexual reproduction on small math models.</p>

<p> The models use the following definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The perfect genome</b> - a predetermined genome that ensures maximum fitness to the environment. </li>
<li><b>Genome</b> - is a sequence of alphabet letters and digits that should achieve the perfect genome via natural selection. </li>
<li><b>Sexual reproduction</b>  - reproduction with genetic recombination between two organisms. </li>
<li><b>Asexual reproduction</b> - reproduction by copying itself. </li>
<li><b>Mutation</b> - a random change in the genome of a new organism.</li>

</ul>

<p>
Reality is a bit more complicated.
</p>
<p>
Not every type of sexual reproduction has gene recombination  <i>(e.g. parthenogenesis)</i>,</br>
while some species with asexual reproduction do have alternate ways to recombine genes<i>(e.g. horizontal gene transfer)</i>
</p>
<p>
The real genome's structure is quite complicated, but in these math models, a simple sequence of digits and letters will be enough.

</p>
<p>
Let's start with the first model.
</p>

<h3>The model's scheme</h3>
<img src="img/model1.png" />

<h4>The direction of selection</h4>
<p>
The blue text on the top is <b>the perfect genome</b>. Each organism should try to achieve it.
<br>
<b>A genome</b> is a sequence of 57 symbols<br>
There are 20 organisms in the model. Their genome is recorded in the rows.<br>
Their initial genome is blank.<br>
The simulation goes for 900 generations.
</p>

<h4>fitness</h4>
<p>
An organism's fitness is measured by the number of matches with the perfect genome.<br>
These matches are marked green.<br>
Total number of matches in organisms is displayed on the left side.
</p>

<h4>Selection</h4>

<p>In each generation, we will leave half of the organisms which then will form the next generation.</p>

<p>We can simply exclude the ones with lower fitness. But we will use a more natural way of selection.</p>
<p>
Fitness will determine the chance of an organism to leave an offspring.<br>
This way, even the weakest organism will have a chance for reproduction and vice-versa.
This will make the simulation a bit closer to reality.</p>

<p>Let's see an example.</p>

<p>
We have three organisms with the fitness of 11, 13, and 12 respectively.<br>
Let's calculate the reproduction probability.</p>

<img src="img/otbor.png" /> <br>

<p>
<ol>
 <li>Ð¡alculate the fitness using the formula: <br>
 <code> new fitness = original fitness - (minimal fitness - 1) </code><br>
The new fitness is 1, 3, 2.
 </li>
 <li>Calculate the sum of fitness/li>
 <li>Generate a random number in the range from 0 (zero) to the resulting sum.<br>
 This random number will determine the probability of leaving an offspring.</li>
</ol>

Using this algorithm, we have the following probabilities:
<ul>
<li> Organism (11) - 16.7 % </li>
<li> Organism (13) - 50.0 % </li>
<li> Organism (12) - 33.3 % </li>
</ul>
</p>


<h4>Reproduction</h4>
<p>
With each step, we select half of the organisms to be the foundation for the next generation.<br>
The hash symbol on the left marks organisms selected to form the next generation.<br>
The type of reproduction is determined by us. Checking the <b>cross</b> checkbox enables <b>sexual reproduction</b>. <br>
<ul>
<li> When <b>asexual reproduction</b> is enabled, each organism selected for reproduction will create two clones of itself. <br>
Each organism will be an ancestor for exactly two organisms in the new generation.
</li>
<li>When <b>sexual reproduction</b> is enabled each organism selected for reproduction will choose a partner and create a new organism whose genome is a random recombination of its parents' genes.<br>
Each organism mates two times to maintain the population.<br>
This way each organism is an ancestor for two or more organisms in the new generation.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<img src="img/reprod.png" />
<h4>Mutations</h4>
<p>
Each organism in a new generation can mutate. <br>
The probability of mutation is set by the user. <br>
When an organism mutates a random symbol in its genome is replaced by another random symbol.
</p>


<h4>Theory</h4>
<p>We have two organisms. Each of them has a beneficial gene in different positions. </p>
<p>
With <b>asexual reproduction</b>, the descendants of only one of the organisms will remain in the population.<br>
Asexual organisms can't recombine genes, so the only source of changes in the population are mutations.
</p>

<p>
With <b>sexual reproduction</b>, both parents can pass their beneficial mutations to a new organism.
</p>

<img src="img/adv.png" />
<p>
This scheme illustrates the advantages of sexual reproduction.<br>
But if you play around with the model, you will notice that the advantage is insignificant.<br>
Only with a high probability of mutation, does sexual reproduction begin to show better results.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sexual reproduction</b> becomes more effective than asexual only if there are many various beneficial mutations in different organisms in the population at the same time.<br>
This way organisms with combined beneficial mutations will appear in each new generation.
</p>

<p>
To boost efficiency even more we can increase the size of the population and genome's length. <br>
The larger the population size, the more beneficial mutations will appear in a generation, and the more effective sexual reproduction becomes.</p>

<p>
But population size also plays a huge role in natural selection.<br>
In a large population, even the small benefits that a new mutation provides will be noticed by natural selection and spread quickly in the population.
</p>

<p>
Now we will see another model showing how the frequency of variants of the same gene in a population changes with the change of generations and how the effectiveness of natural selection depends on the size of the population.

 <p>Some definitions before we begin:</p> 
<ul>  
<li><b>Alleles</b> - different variants of the same gene</li>
<li><b>Genetic drift</b> - the change in the frequency of an existing gene variant (allele) in a population due to random chance</li>   
</ul>   

<p>
Different variants of the same gene (alleles) may be present in the population.<br>
If each allele is equally beneficial, then during the transition to the next generation a random shift in allele frequencies will happen.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, the smaller the population size, the more drastic changes in the frequency of alleles will occur.<br>
In a population of limited size, one allele will eventually displace the other.<br>
The smaller the population size, the faster this will happen.
</p>
<p>
In a large population, if an allele gives an advantage, then the more likely it is to replace all other alleles.<br>
In a small population, even an advantageous allele can disappear due to random frequency fluctuation.
</p>
<p style="background-color:rgb(255,255,100);" >
In small populations, <b>genetic drift</b> can be more impactful than <b>natural selection</b>.</b>.<br>
</p>
<p>You can see it in the screenshots below. <br>
The graphs show the distribution of the advantageous allele in the population. 
</p>
<p>
The left graph shows four simulations with a population size of 1000.<br>
In two out of four cases, the allele disappeared despite being advantageous.
</p>
<p>
The right graph shows four simulations with a population size of 256000.<br>
Natural selection spreads the allele in the population.
</p>

<img src="img/drf1.png" />

<h4>How it works in the model</h4>
<p>
Let's say there are two variants of the same gene in the population:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Variant <b>A</b></li>
<li>Variant <b>B</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Before launching the model we can set the:</p>
<ol>
<li>The size of the population</li>
<li>the advantage of <b>Variant A</b> over <b>Variant B</b></li>
<li>Initial distribution of Variant <b>A</b> in the population</li>
</ol>
<p>
The model simulates frequency changes of four pairs of alleles at once. The pairs are marked with different colors.
</p>

<p>
To calculate the allele's frequency the following algorithm is used:
</p>
<p>
Lets say the size of the population = 1000, where Variant A = 400, Variant B = 600
</p>

<p>
We generate a random number in the range from 0 to 1000.
</p>
<ul>
<li>If this number is within a range of 0 to 400, we get an organism with the <b>Variant A</b> gene. </li>
<li>If this number is within a range of 400 to 1000, we get an organism with the <b>Variant B</b> gene.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If Variant  <b>A</b> has a <b> 1 % </b> advantage, we increase the range by <b> 1% </b> and get <b> 404</b> .
</p>
<p>
We generate a random number within a range of 0 to 1004 <i>(404 + 600)</i>
</p>
<ul>
<li>If this number is within a range of 0 to 404, we get an organism with the <b>Variant A</b> gene. </li>
<li>If this number is within a range of 404 to 1004, we get an organism with the <b>Variant B</b> gene.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The model's scheme</h3> 
<p> This is an improved version of the first model. To see the advantages of natural selection, I increased the size of the population <i>(600, 1800, 5400)</i>  and the length of the genome  <i>(224)</i>.
</p>
 
 <p> 
 Each gene can increase fitness by one point, decrease it by one, or have no effect at all.<br>
 The probability of negative mutation is 90 times higher.
 </p>
 
<ul> 
 <li>Negative Mutation - 90 % </li>
 <li>Neutral Mutation - 9 % </li>
 <li>Beneficial Mutation - 1 % </li>
 </ul>
 
  <img src="img/gn90.png" /> <br>
 

 
<p> 
  You can choose different types of presentation:
  	<ul>
  	<li><b>genom</b> - The default mode. Each gene is represented by 1-pixel-wide bar. Beneficial genes are marked blue and negative - orange.</li>
  	<li><b>bar</b> - a bar chart showing the prevalence of negative and beneficial mutations in each gene in a population. </li>
  	<li><b>graph</b> - a graph showing the fitness value of the best organism in the population.  <br>
  	There are also graphs of the average number of negative and beneficial mutations in one organism.
  	</li>
  	</ul>
</p> 

<h4> Asexual VS Sexual </h4>

 <p> 
By experimenting with the model, we can make sure that sexual reproduction <i>(cross)</i> not only increases the rate at which the fitness of the population grows but also increases the limit to which fitness can reach.
</p> 
 <p>
 In the third image,  <b>sexual reproduction</b> was disabled and fitness immediately began to decline.
  </p>

 <img src="img/main3.png" /> <br>
 
 
<h4>Mutation probability and its effect on the rate of evolution</h4>
 <p>
 <b>probability of mutation</b> defines the probability for mutation <i>(random change of a gene)</i> to occur in a new organism.<br>
 </p>
 
  <p>
The model shows that <b>sexual reproduction</b> does not significantly affect the evolution of the population.<br>
Genetic recombination quickly accumulates beneficial mutations and displaces negative ones.<br>
Moreover, with an increase in the probability of mutations the rate of evolution also increases.
  </p>

  <p>
With <b>asexual reproduction</b>, an increase in the probability of mutations limits the maximum level of fitness.
  </p>
  
  <img src="img/mutprob.png" /> <br>

 <h4>Disabling mutations</h4>
 <p>The model allows disabling mutation by setting the probability to zero.</p> 

 <p> 
 Without mutations all the organisms will quickly achieve one common genome.
 </p>

  <p>
  With <b>sexual reproduction</b>, a significant part of beneficial genes will remain, while most of the negative ones will be displaced from the genome.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  With <b>asexual reproduction</b>, the population will become clones of one type of organism.<br>
We can launch the model a few times and see how groups of clones compete.<br>
The last surviving genome type is a clone of one of the original organisms.
  </p>

   <img src="img/mut.png" /> <br>
   
   <p>
   This experiment very clearly shows the advantage of <b>sexual reproduction</b>. <br>
   And if we increase a population from 600 to 5400, then with sexual reproduction an almost perfect genome will appear, with only a few genes missing.
   </p>
   <img src="img/mut0.png" /> <br>
   <p>
   With <b>asexual reproduction</b>, the result will be clones of one of the original organisms.
   </p>
   

 <h4> Force of selection </h4>
 <p>
 <b> force of selection </b> defines the intensity of natural selection in the model. <br>
 
The higher it is, the less likely it is for the less fit to leave offspring<br>
 The image below shows the probability of leaving offspring for individuals with fitness of <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>.
 </p>
  <img src="img/otbor2.png" /><br> 
 <p>
 Setting the parameter to  <b>0</b> , disables natural selection. <br>
The probability of leaving offspring is completely random for each organism.
 </p>
 <p>
In the first model, I've explained how natural selection works.<br>
Now, the formula is:<br><br>
  <code> new fitness = original fitness - (minimal fitness - constant) </code> <br><br>
  The constant value depends on the  <b> force of selection </b> 
  <ol><li><b>100</b></li><li><b>10</b></li><li><b>1</b></li></ol>
 </p>
 
  <p>
  With the value of the <b>force of selection = 1</b>, the difference in the selection is a fraction of a percent, but development still occurs.
  </p>
  
  <img src="img/power.png" /> <br> 
 
   <p>
   If you disable selection, <b> force of selection = 0</b>, the population's genome will quickly return to its original state, where each gene will have a random value.
   </p>
 
 
<h4> The size of the population</h4>
<p>
The size of the population greatly affects its development.<br>
</p>
<p>
The model has three available sizes <i>(600, 1800, 5400)</i><br>
<i>(Only 600 genomes are visible in the Genome mode)</i>
</p>
